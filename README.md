# Algerian Forest Fires Prediction Project

## Project Description:
The Algerian Forest Fires Prediction Project is a machine learning-based web application developed to predict the likelihood of forest fires in Algeria based on environmental and meteorological data. The project involved extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the use of Ridge Regression to build a reliable predictive model. The application allows users to input specific conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and get predictions on the fire risk through an intuitive web interface built using Flask.

The goal of this project was to create a tool that could assist in forecasting fire risks and help prevent devastating forest fires by providing timely predictions.

## Key Features:
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Removed outliers and handled missing data to ensure a high-quality dataset.
Standardized and normalized features like temperature, wind speed, and humidity to enhance model performance.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized key trends and relationships between variables such as temperature and fire occurrence.
Performed correlation analysis to understand which features most influenced fire risk.

### Feature Engineering:
Generated new features (e.g., drought index, temperature variation) to improve predictive accuracy.
Ensured that the model captured essential environmental dynamics for fire prediction.

### Machine Learning with Ridge Regression:
Built and trained a Ridge Regression model to predict the probability of forest fires.
Implemented hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and avoid overfitting.

### Flask Web Application:
Developed an interactive and user-friendly web interface where users can input environmental data and receive fire risk predictions.
The back-end logic processes user inputs and runs the prediction model to generate results.

### Model Evaluation:
Used cross-validation and performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to evaluate the modelâ€™s effectiveness.
Compared the model's performance on both training and test datasets to ensure generalization.

## Technologies Used:
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning Framework: scikit-learn (Ridge Regression)
Web Development: Flask, HTML, CSS
Data Analysis & Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
